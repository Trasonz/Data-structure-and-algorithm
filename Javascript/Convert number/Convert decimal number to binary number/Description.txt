The Divide by 2 algorithm

The Divide by 2 algorithm assumes that we start with an integer greater than 0. A simple iteration then continually divides the decimal number by 2 and keeps track of the remainder. 

The first division by 2 gives information as to whether the value is even or odd. An even value will have a remainder of 0. It will have the digit 0 in the ones place. An odd value will have a remainder of 1 and will have the digit 1 in the ones place. 

We think about building our binary number as a sequence of digits; the first remainder we compute will actually be the last digit in the sequence.
